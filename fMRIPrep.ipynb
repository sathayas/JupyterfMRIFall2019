    "As you saw in the previous class, writing your own script for fMRI data pre-processing is a laborious work. Fortunately, there are a number of pre-processing tools written by others. If you choose to use such a tool, then you just run the tool and your data is pre-processed, ready to be analyzed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Your lab may have an fMRI pre-processing script handed down through generations of previous graduate students and post-docs. (I may be wrong, but) Such scripts are often based on a single software tool (probably either SPM or FSL). However, in recent years, it is becoming more common to mix and match different pre-processing steps from multiple software tools. fMRIPrep is a great example of that. \n",
    "\n",
    "**fMRIPrep** is a popular tool for fMRI data pre-processing. It combines multiple brain image processing tools to normalize T1-weighted images and fMRI data into the MNI template space. The default pipeline in fMRIPrep consists of FreeSurfer (surface extraction), ANTS (warping), FSL (segmentation), AFNI (physiological noise correction), and a number of other tools. You can pre-process your fMRI data (along with the accompanying T1 images) as long as your data set is organized in the BIDS structure. "
