    "This course covers basics of fMRI data processing and analysis. Due to the sheer amount of data, fMRI data analysis requires a number of tools to process data (pre-processing) and to perform statistical inference. I will introduce you to the tools necessary for fMRI data analysis. We will cover:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Python coding**: Knowing some Python enables you to script to automate some aspects of fMRI data analysis. Also, Python is becoming a *lingua franca* in scientific computing (along with R and MATLAB).\n",
    "* **Pre-processing steps**: You can't analyze fMRI data coming out of an MRI scanner. There are necessary steps to prepare your data. You will learn why we do what we do in pre-processing fMRI data.\n",
    "* **Statistical methods, temporal & spatial**: Because fMRI data contains a series of 3D images, you need special statistical methods to analyze such data.\n",
    "* **Cool new stuff**: Machine learning (dimension reduction, clustering, classification) has been applied to fMRI data. "
