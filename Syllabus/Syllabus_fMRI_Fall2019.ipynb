    "  * Code simple Python programs for data processing and automation\n",
    "  * Manage data and codes associated with their data processing and analysis\n",
    "  * Understand steps involved in fMRI data pre-processing and statistical analysis\n",

If you choose to use your own laptop, your laptop has to have a sufficiently large memory to handle data sets used in this course. I recommend a system with at least 4GB of RAM per CPU core.

However, if you use a computer in the classroom, the data and codes used during the class will remain on that computer.\n",
