    "## What will I learn?\n",
    "Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:\n",
    "  * Code simple Python programs for data processing and automation\n",
    "  * Manage data and codes associated with their data processing and analysis\n",
    "  * Understand steps involved in fMRI data pre-processing and statistical analysis\n",

    "During the demonstration, the instructor will demonstrate a tool(s) associated with the topic for the day. This will include explanations of a pertinent software tool, how to code / use it,\n",
    "and an example of an analysis using that tool. There will be some hands-on exercises so that\n",

    "\n",
    "The course consists of three parts:\n",
    "  * **Python coding** (Weeks 1-2): Covers basics of Python coding and tools for coding.\n",
    "  * **Fundamentals** (Weeks 3-8): Covers concepts on pre-processing and statistical analysis of fMRI data, mainly from the textbook.\n",

However, if you use a computer in the classroom, the data and codes used during the class will remain on that computer.\n",

For that reason, attendance is mandatory. If a student is unable to attend a class for a legitimate reason (e.g., religious holidays, conferences, illness, family emergencies, jury duty, etc.), he or she must obtain a prior approval from the instructor. Any unexcused absence will result in loss of 2 points in the attendance score for each occurrence.

    "have not presented before, or who have presented fewer times than other students. The\n",
