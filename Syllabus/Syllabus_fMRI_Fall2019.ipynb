    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What will I learn?\n",
    "Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:\n",
    "  * Code simple Python programs for data processing and automation\n",
    "  * Manage data and codes associated with their data processing and analysis\n",
    "  * Understand steps involved in fMRI data pre-processing and statistical analysis\n",
    "  * Understand basic concepts in machine learning\n",
    "  * Summarize and articulate concepts on fMRI data processing\n",

    "For the presentation, a student will present a book chapter or an article related to the topic of the day. This presentation is informal and analogous to a journal club. \n",

    "During the demonstration, the instructor will demonstrate a tool(s) associated with the topic for the day. This will include explanations of a pertinent software tool, how to code / use it,\n",

    "\n",
    "The course consists of three parts:\n",
    "  * **Python coding** (Weeks 1-2): Covers basics of Python coding and tools for coding.\n",
    "  * **Fundamentals** (Weeks 3-8): Covers concepts on pre-processing and statistical analysis of fMRI data, mainly from the textbook.\n",
    "  * **New stuff** (Weeks 9-13): Covers new analysis methods based on machine learning, mainly from the current literature. \n",
